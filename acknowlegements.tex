My deep gratitude goes to my thesis advisor, Dr. Gabriel Ferrer for his patience and guidance. I would also like to take this moment to thank every faculty member of the Hendrix College Math and Computer Science department for their relentless support. To all students and other friends who helped me or encouraged me in any way when I was working on this project, I can only say thank you!
